## Screenshots

Put two or three real screenshots at phone size in `docs/assets/`, then replace
this paragraph with them:

```markdown
| Home | Detail | Add |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Home](docs/assets/screen-home.png) | ![Detail](docs/assets/screen-detail.png) | ![Add](docs/assets/screen-add.png) |
```

A repo without screenshots reads as abandoned, whatever the code says.

## What it does

- Discover, save, and add recipes.
- Plan and manage meals for the week.
- Track pantry items and monitor expiration dates.
- Create grocery lists based on planned meals.

## Built with

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | Flutter (Dart) |
| State | `setState` / provider / riverpod (say which) |
| Storage | shared_preferences / Hive / Drift / Firebase / Supabase / other |
| Other packages | list the ones that matter, with a word on why |

## Running it yourself

```bash
flutter pub get
cp .env.example .env      # only if your app needs keys, see below
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8080
```

Then open http://localhost:8080. Requires Flutter (run `flutter --version` and
put yours here).

### Environment variables

This project reads its configuration from a `.env` file that is **not** in the
repository. Copy `.env.example`, fill in your own values, and never commit the
result.

| Variable | What it is | Where to get one |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EXAMPLE_API_KEY` | ... | ... |

## Privacy and secrets

Required section. Two or three honest sentences:

- What personal data this app stores, if any, and where it goes.
- Where the secrets live (`.env` locally, repository secrets in the deploy
  workflow) and what protects the data on the service side (Firestore rules,
  Supabase RLS, or "nothing leaves the device").
- Confirm that all sample data, screenshots and the video contain **no real
  personal information**.

## Status and what is next

Be honest. What works, what is half done, what you would build next. An honest
"known issues" section reads better than a claim the reader disproves in thirty
seconds.

- People who helped, and how

## AI use

If you used AI tools while building this, say so in a sentence or two and say
where. Honest disclosure is the standard in this course and increasingly outside
it.
